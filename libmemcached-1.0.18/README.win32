Hi, 

So you want to know how to build libmemcached on Windows? In order to
have a single build environment you need to install mingw to get a
"unix environment" to run the configure script.

An easy way to get started is to install the msysgit fullinstall
package from: http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list

msysgit does not contain the "autotools" needed to generate a
configure script, so you need to generate that on another box (this
should not be a problem if you're trying to build from a tar archive).

msysgit does not contain the tools to build the documentation, so you
need to add --without-docs to configure.

I'm normally building libmemcached with:

Ex:
$ ./configure --without-docs --with-memcached=../memcached/memcached.exe
$ make all install

Happy hacking,

Trond Norbye
